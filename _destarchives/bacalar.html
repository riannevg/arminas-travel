and natural beauty, stands out for its unique landscapes and relaxed pace of life.

    The main attraction of Bacalar is clearly its stunning lagoon, a 42-kilometer stretch of crystal-clear
water that shifts from turquoise to deep blue. A must-visit landmark is the Bacalar Fort, also known
as the Fort of San Felipe. This 18th-century fortress offers panoramic views of the lagoon and
houses a museum that explores the town’s pirate-filled past. Another gem is Cenote Azul, a deep
natural sinkhole, perfect for swimming and diving, surrounded by lush greenery.

hideout.
