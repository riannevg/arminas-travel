Kempinski Hotel in Cancun
The Kempinski Hotel is a classical hotel, but the best thing about it is the beach and the amazing turquoise color of the water. It's recently renovated, having been passed from the Ritz Carlton to Kempinski. It's a classic hotel with all good amenities you would expect from a hotel in this area.
