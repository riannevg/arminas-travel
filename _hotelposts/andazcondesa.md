Hotel Andaz Condesa
Condesa was a local neighborhood with many rich hipsters and young people from various countries, but it never had a great hotel like those in Reforma and Polanco. Now, Hotel Andaz is changing that. This amazing hotel showcases modern and contemporary art, vibrant colors, and offers excellent food. It's located in the center of Condesa and is a very good hotel. It's like a boutique hotel but without the "boutique." It integrates very well into Condesa and fits perfectly there.
