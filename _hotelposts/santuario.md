## El Santuario Resort & Spa – Valle de Bravo  
&nbsp;  

### Introduction  
Perched gracefully atop a quartz mountain at 1,600 meters above sea level, **El Santuario Resort & Spa** invites you to a sanctuary where the spirit of Pacha Mama guides every detail. Here, the architecture breathes with the mountain's energy—blending healing mineral resonance, meditative design, and the poetic language of ancestral wisdom—to craft a refuge where your senses align and your soul finds clarity.

### Location  
A mere ten-minute drive from Valle de Bravo’s picturesque town centre, this hideaway sprawls over the tranquil shores of Lake Avándaro. Surrounded by fragrant pine forests and enveloped in sweeping views, it offers effortless access to the cultural heart of Valle, the artisanal market, and the natural serenity of the lake.

### What to Do  
Begin your day with sunrise yoga or meditation amidst the framed horizon, before melting into world-class spa experiences—each designed as a journey of renewal. Sink into private plunge pools or unwind beside the tranquil outdoor pools and hot jacuzzis tucked within the gardens. Dine at **Na-Ha Restaurant**, where local ingredients are transformed into refined Mexican cuisine, or indulge in gourmet room service surrounded by nature’s calm.
