Banyan Tree Mayakoba. It's all about villas. Banyan Tree is famous for their villas and spas all over the world. We can see the Asian design because it's an Asian chain, but we can also see a combination with Mexican design and food with the Asian touches.
Banyan actually built a huge new part; it's like another hotel. The new part is exactly on the beach and mainly offers suites with two floors. However, for the main complex of the villas, only three-bedroom villas are on the beach; the one-bedroom villas are in the jungle side. All the villas have views of the water. This place is very discreet and private and has a very good ambiance. You can be nude in your villa and feel very comfortable.
