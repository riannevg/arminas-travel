### Introduction

Boca de Agua is an architectural jewel and eco-conscious hideaway on the shores of Bacalar’s legendary lagoon. This visionary retreat blends minimalist design with the raw beauty of nature, offering guests an intimate encounter with one of Mexico’s most magical destinations. Surrounded by pristine jungle and the “Lagoon of Seven Colours,” the hotel is a serene sanctuary for dreamers, artists, and modern explorers.

### Location

Located just outside the town of Bacalar, Boca de Agua is tucked between tropical forest and turquoise waters, offering both immersion and escape. The property feels deeply secluded, yet is within reach of Bacalar’s laid-back town centre, artisanal shops, and the Fort of San Felipe. Chetumal Airport is just under an hour away, making this secret corner of the Yucatán Peninsula surprisingly accessible.

### What to Do

Wake up to still waters and birdsong, then dive straight into the lagoon from your private deck. Paddle through translucent channels by kayak, explore nearby cenotes, or visit ancient Mayan sites hidden in the jungle. Take a slow bike ride into town or enjoy an afternoon siesta in the shade of your treehouse. Evenings are for natural wine, candlelight, and deep, quiet rest under star-strewn skies.
