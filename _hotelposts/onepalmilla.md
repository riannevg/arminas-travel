One&Only is one of the most famous hotel chains in the world, and in this case, they do have a beach where swimming is possible. This chain usually absorbs the local air and culture in the design, cuisine, and service, and you have a lot of details of Mexico. The colors are amazing in this hotel. It's on the first line of the beach, but you need to walk some minutes to access the beach. Even though you see the sea from your room, it's stones, you can't go straight to the beach. You need to walk a few minutes to reach the beach. The beach isn't directly accessible from the rooms. The majority of rooms have ocean views.
