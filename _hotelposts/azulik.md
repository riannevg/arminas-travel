### Introduction

AZULIK Tulum is not just a hotel — it is a sanctuary of reconnection, a sensorial escape where nature, art, and spirituality intertwine. Perched on the lush coastline of the Riviera Maya, this iconic eco-luxury retreat invites guests to unplug from the modern world and surrender to a rhythm shaped by the sea, jungle, and sacred Mayan traditions. Every element of AZULIK is designed to awaken the senses and nourish the soul.

### Location

Located on Tulum’s serene beachfront, AZULIK is minutes away from the town’s vibrant centre, yet feels worlds apart. Surrounded by protected jungle and the Caribbean Sea, the property offers privacy, seclusion, and a direct connection to nature. It’s an ideal base for exploring cenotes, Mayan ruins, or simply enjoying the crystalline waters of the Riviera Maya.

### What to Do

At AZULIK, the experience goes far beyond the beach. Attend a spiritual ceremony, join a sound healing session, or explore the multidisciplinary art spaces at SFER IK, the hotel’s strikingly organic creative hub. Guests can visit nearby archaeological sites like Tulum and Cobá, swim in sacred cenotes, or bike along the lush coastal roads. Back at the hotel, unwind with an open-air massage or simply listen to the waves from your treetop villa.
