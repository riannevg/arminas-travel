One of the most popular hotels in Tulum is Casa Malca Hotel. It has a fascinating story; many people say it was the former house of the drug lord Pablo Escobar and even call it "Casa de Escobar." I think it may be true. It's not very small; it has 70 rooms, making it much better than most hotels in Tulum. It has several advantages: it's a good hotel with excellent services, amenities, and spas.

It has an amazing location at the end of Tulum, making it hard to reach but also outside of the party zone, away from the noise and permanent entertainment.
The noise in other hotels may come from other nearby hotels, restaurants, or cafes itâ€™s crazy ..

It features numerous art installations from the private collection of Senor Malca, the owner, who is also an art collector in New York. These installations are always changing as he rotates his art, and each room is unique, showcasing a piece of art from Senor Malca's collection.

The entire hotel is alive and always changing, with unusual displays like the wedding dress installation. Additionally, the hotel has a beautiful beach that is well maintained and cleaned regularly, ensuring a pristine environment free from seaweed and other debris.
