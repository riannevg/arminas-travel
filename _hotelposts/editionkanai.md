### What to Do  
Begin the day with sunrise yoga overlooking the sea, followed by a dip in the infinity pool that seems to melt into the turquoise horizon. Explore the nearby area, dive into the crystalline cenotes of the peninsula, or enjoy curated cultural excursions that reveal the artistry and spirit of the Mayan world. Within the resort, guests can indulge in bespoke spa rituals, join sound-healing sessions, or simply unwind on a private stretch of untouched beach. Evenings come alive with curated dining, world-class mixology, and the rhythmic pulse of the Riviera Maya under starlit skies.
