The Ritz-Carlton in Mexico City is an amazing touristic  product.
Unlike the traditional Four Seasons, which is also amazing,
The Ritz offers a modern and contemporary style. With its impressive height of around 56-57 floors, it provides a blend of modern and classic hotel experiences. Guests can enjoy breathtaking views from the windows. In my opinion, it's the one of the best hotels in Mexico City.
