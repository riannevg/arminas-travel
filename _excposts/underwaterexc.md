## Underwater Museum (MUSA)

&nbsp;

In 2009, a groundbreaking underwater museum called MUSA (Museo Subacuático de Arte) was established in the crystal-clear waters surrounding Cancun, Isla Mujeres, and Punta Nizuc. This monumental project was initiated by Jaime González Cano, Director of the National Marine Park, Roberto Díaz Abraham, then President of the Cancun Nautical Association, and renowned English sculptor Jason deCaires Taylor. Today, MUSA boasts over 500 permanent life-size sculptures, making it one of the largest and most ambitious underwater art attractions in the world.

### Art Meets Environmental Science

MUSA’s mission is to intertwine art with environmental science. The museum’s sculptures are crafted from specialized materials designed to encourage coral growth and marine life colonization. By creating an artificial reef, the museum not only showcases contemporary art but also contributes to marine conservation efforts. The installations cover over 420 square meters of previously barren sea bed and collectively weigh more than 200 tons.

### Benefits to Marine Life

The Cancun-Isla Mujeres Marine Park is one of the world’s most visited marine environments, receiving over 750,000 visitors annually. MUSA plays a crucial role in alleviating the pressure on natural reefs by redirecting visitors to this innovative site. This diversion helps in the recovery and preservation of the natural reefs while simultaneously enhancing the region's ecological health.

### Galleries and Diving Experience

MUSA is divided into two distinct galleries:

- **Salon Manchones**: Located at a depth of eight meters, this gallery is accessible to both divers and snorkelers. It offers a unique opportunity to explore a vast array of underwater sculptures.
- **Salon Nizuc**: Positioned four meters deep, this gallery is designated for snorkeling only, providing a more accessible experience for those who prefer to stay closer to the surface.

Over the years, MUSA has garnered international acclaim and has significantly boosted the region’s profile through extensive media coverage. Dive into this extraordinary underwater world and witness the seamless fusion of art and marine conservation.
