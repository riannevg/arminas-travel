## Uxmal & Celestun

&nbsp;  
### Uxmal

The day begins with a visit to Uxmal, one of the most majestic archaeological sites of the ancient Maya civilisation. Unlike other Mayan cities, Uxmal is distinguished by its intricate Puuc-style architecture—elegant stone carvings, expansive palace facades, and smooth, curved pyramids that reflect the city’s ceremonial significance. Highlights include the towering Pyramid of the Magician, the impressive Nunnery Quadrangle, and the Governor’s Palace, all harmoniously integrated into the lush Yucatán landscape. As you walk among the ruins, your guide will share fascinating stories and insights into the rituals, astronomy, and architectural mastery of the Maya people.

### Celestun 

In the afternoon, the tour continues to Celestún, a coastal biosphere reserve renowned for its extraordinary biodiversity and tranquil natural beauty. Here, you’ll embark on a boat journey through the mangroves, where you may observe colonies of vibrant pink flamingos and a variety of native and migratory birds. The calm waters and unspoiled surroundings offer a peaceful contrast to the grandeur of Uxmal. With a chance to spot wildlife in its natural habitat and even enjoy a swim in the freshwater springs, Celestún provides a refreshing and memorable end to this journey through culture and nature.
