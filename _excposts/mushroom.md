## Mushroom Foraging with the Mazahua
**Seasonal experience: June to November**

&nbsp;

### The Mazahua Indigenous groups

Step into the heart of Mazahua territory for a rare, immersive day in nature and culture. This unique experience takes you into the highland forests of central Mexico (Valle de Bravo), where you'll join a Mazahua community member for a guided hike through their ancestral lands.
The Mazahua are one of the largest Indigenous groups in central Mexico, known for their deep connection to the land, vibrant textiles, and strong traditions of herbal medicine and sustainable agriculture. During the hike, your guide will share ancient knowledge of the region’s flora, including medicinal plants and edible mushrooms.

During our forest hike, we’ll have the unique opportunity to search for a variety of edible wild mushrooms that grow in the highland forests of Valle de Bravo.

### Mushroom foraging

Guided by a Mazahua community member, we’ll learn to identify some of the most prized local species, including Porcini (Boletus edulis), Caesar’s Mushroom (Amanita caesarea), Chanterelles (Cantharellus cibarius), Saffron Milk Caps (Lactarius deliciosus), and Russulas (Russula spp.), among others.

These mushrooms flourish during the rainy season — typically from June to November — and are deeply connected to Mazahua traditions, both in cuisine and herbal knowledge. As we walk, we’ll also hear about the sustainable ways the community gathers these forest treasures and how they are used in traditional cooking.

### Traditional lunch

After our walk, we’ll return to the village where you’ll take part in a hands-on tortilla-making session and enjoy a warm, home-cooked lunch prepared by our hosts using locally grown ingredients and any mushrooms we’ve foraged.

The meal is accompanied by Agua Fresca and Pulque, a lightly fermented ancestral drink made from agave, followed by Té de Monte, a soothing herbal infusion from the surrounding forest.

Optionally, the mushrooms we forage may be prepared for a dinner. Return to our hotel in the capital.
