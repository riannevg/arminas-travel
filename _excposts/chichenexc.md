## Chichen Itza  
&nbsp;  

### The Sacred City of the Itza

Chichen Itza, meaning “Mouth of the well of the Itza,” is a renowned archaeological site located 75 miles east of Merida in the Yucatan Peninsula. Once a sacred city, Chichen Itza is one of the most significant Maya cultural sites, covering an area of approximately six square miles. While many of its structures are now mounds, over thirty buildings remain visible to tourists.

### Two Eras of Architecture

The site is divided into two architectural groups. The first belongs to the Classic Maya Period (7th-10th centuries A.D.), during which Chichen Itza thrived as a ceremonial center. The second group, from the Maya-Toltec Period (10th-13th centuries A.D.), includes iconic structures like the Sacred Well and other remarkable ruins.

### Flourishing of the Arts

During the Classic Period’s Central Phase (625-800 A.D.), Chichen Itza became a prominent religious center. Structures like the Red House, Nunnery, Church, and Temple of the Three Lintels were built, showcasing the city's significance in arts and sciences. However, by the end of the 7th century, the Itza people abandoned the city, returning only in the 10th century A.D.

### The Toltec Alliance

Around 1000 A.D., the Itza allied with the Xio and Cocom tribes, leading to the construction of grand buildings influenced by Toltec art. This era saw the rise of Kukulkan’s Pyramid, the Temple of the Warriors, and the Group of a Thousand Columns. The Toltec influence also brought about large-scale human sacrifices, particularly at the Cenote of Sacrifice.

### Kukulkan’s Pyramid

The most iconic structure is Kukulkan’s Pyramid, also known as El Castillo. This 75-foot-tall pyramid was built for astronomical purposes. During the equinoxes, the play of light creates the illusion of a serpent descending the pyramid, symbolizing the descent of Kukulkan, the feathered serpent deity.
