## Chichen Itza  
&nbsp;  

During your tour today we will visit one of the new 7 world wonders, Chichen Itza, the archeological site. 

Step into the awe-inspiring world of Chichén Itzá, one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. This ancient Maya city is home to the iconic Kukulkán Pyramid, an architectural masterpiece that showcases the Maya's incredible knowledge of astronomy and engineering. As you walk through the expansive site, discover sacred temples, the impressive ball court, and intricate stone carvings that tell stories of a powerful civilization. A visit to Chichén Itzá is a journey back in time—and a must-see highlight of any trip to the Yucatán.

### Swim in a cenote

A cenote is a natural sinkhole filled with freshwater, formed when limestone bedrock collapses to reveal the groundwater beneath. These magical pools, found mainly in Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula, were considered sacred by the ancient Maya. After visiting Chichen Itza  you will go to a cenote where you can have a refreshing dip in the water.
