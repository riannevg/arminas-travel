### Main Information
The whale shark is a slow-moving filter feeding shark and the largest known extant fish species. In 2011, more than 400 whale sharks gathered off the Yucatan Coast. It was one of the largest gatherings of whale sharks recorded. Aggregations in that area are among the most reliable seasonal gatherings known for whale sharks, with large numbers occurring in most years between May and September.

Seasonal feeding aggregations occur at several coastal sites such as Isla Mujeres and Isla Holbox and Contoy island in Yucatan, Mexico. Despite its size, the whale shark does not pose significant danger to humans. Whale sharks are docile fish and sometimes allow swimmers to catch a ride.

Highlights
Swim with the Whale Sharks in the beautiful waters of Mexican Caribean, meet this majestic animal face to face and top off your day with snorkeling. This activity in Cancun is truly amazing and not to be missed.
