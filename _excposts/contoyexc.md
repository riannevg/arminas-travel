### Main Information
Contoy is a small island, approximately 30 km north of Isla Mujeres, Mexico. Enjoy this unforgettable experience of crossing the majestic Caribbean Sea to a place that only a few have had a privilege to discover. The virgin island of Contoy is situated at the beginning of the second largest coral reef chain in the world. Its beaches are shallow, clear, calm. The underwater life is abundant and thrilling for snorkeling. It is internationally famous for its flora and fauna, especially for its birds.

With over 150 species, this, also called the island of the birds, is the most important shelter for sea birds in the Mexican Caribbean. Contoy, which has been a protected area since 1961, is located in the transition zone between the warm, clear waters of the Caribbean and the deep, cold waters of the Gulf of Mexico.
