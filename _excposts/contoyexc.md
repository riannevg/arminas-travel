## Isla Contoy  
&nbsp;  

### Discover a Hidden Paradise

Venture to Isla Contoy, a small, untouched gem just 30 km north of Isla Mujeres. Cross the majestic Caribbean Sea to reach this virgin island, a privilege granted to only a few. Nestled at the beginning of the worldâ€™s second-largest coral reef chain, Isla Contoy boasts shallow, clear, and calm beaches, making it a snorkeling paradise with an abundance of vibrant underwater life.

### A Haven for Wildlife Enthusiasts

Isla Contoy is internationally renowned for its rich flora and fauna, particularly its incredible bird population. Known as the "Island of the Birds," this sanctuary is home to over 150 species of sea birds, making it the most important refuge in the Mexican Caribbean.  

### Protected Natural Beauty

Since 1961, Isla Contoy has been a protected area, preserving its natural beauty and diverse ecosystems. The island lies in the transition zone between the warm, crystal-clear waters of the Caribbean and the deeper, cooler waters of the Gulf of Mexico, offering a unique environment for both marine and birdlife.
