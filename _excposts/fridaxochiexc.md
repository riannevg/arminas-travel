## Frida Kahlo Museum, Leon Trotsky Museum & Xochimilco

&nbsp;

Explore the vibrant districts of Coyoacan and Xochimilco in Mexico City, known for their rich cultural and historical significance. This immersive tour takes you through the lives of two intriguing figures and offers a unique glimpse into the city's past.

### Frida Kahlo Museum in Coyoacan, Mexico City

Step into the world of the iconic Mexican painter Frida Kahlo at her former home, known as the "Blue House." This charming residence, where Frida lived with her husband Diego Rivera from 1929 until her death in 1954, remains a time capsule of their lives. The museum preserves the rooms as they were during her lifetime, showcasing personal mementoes, artworks by Frida and Diego, and a collection of 18th and 19th-century Mexican art.

Leon Trotsky, the exiled Russian revolutionary, also resided here briefly in 1937. The museum’s collection includes pre-Columbian artifacts and examples of Mexican folk art from Frida's personal collection.

### Leon Trotsky Museum

Visit the Leon Trotsky Museum, located in the historic district of Coyoacan. This site provides insight into the life of Trotsky during his years in exile in Mexico. The museum houses a collection of artifacts and exhibits related to his revolutionary activities and his stay in Mexico.

### Xochimilco

Experience the picturesque floating gardens of Xochimilco, just an hour south of Mexico City’s historical center. Glide through the ancient canals on a colorful flat-bottomed boat, marveling at the ingenious agricultural system developed by the Aztecs. This system of floating gardens, or "chinampas," was crucial for sustaining the Aztec capital.

During the boat ride, visit the enigmatic Island of the Dolls, a unique attraction with its own eerie charm. Enjoy a traditional Mexican lunch on the boat (included in the tour price, with drinks available for purchase). 

Discover the artistic legacy of Frida Kahlo, the historical significance of Leon Trotsky, and the scenic beauty of Xochimilco on this comprehensive cultural tour.
