### Frida Kahlo Museum in Coyoacan, Mexico City
This little blue house was the birthplace of the painter Frida Kahlo (1907-54), who was confined to a wheelchair and lived here with her husband Diego Rivera from 1929 until her death. The rooms have been left just as they were during her lifetime. Leon Trotsky stayed in the house as a guest after his arrival in Mexico in 1937. In addition to personal mementoes and works by Frida and her husband the museum contains pictures and sculptures by 18th and 19th c. Mexican artists, as well as pre-Columbian objects and examples of Mexican folk-art from Frida Kahlo’s private collection.

Excursion to the museum of Frida Kahlo takes approximately one hour.

### Leon Trotsky Museum
Xochimilco is an incredibly scenic area in the south of Mexico City, just an hour south from Mexico City’s historical centre. On this tour you can drift in a flat-bottomed boat through the lovely floating gardens of Xochimilco and marvel at the once-enormous agrarian canal system that fed the Aztec capital. In Aztec times, with prime farmland being scarce, the Indians developed a system of floating reed mats loaded with soil and used them as gardens. It is now your chance to experience this wonder that took place so long ago! Though Xochimilco was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987, with environmental degradation, slow urbanization and dropping water tables, what is left of the canals is fast disappearing.

During the boating we will visit the legendary Island of the Dolls. Also, we organize a traditional Mexican lunch on the boat (included in the price, drinks not included).

Transfer to your hotel in Mexico City.
