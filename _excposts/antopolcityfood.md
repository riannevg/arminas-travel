## City Tour Mexico City, Museum of Anthropology & Taco Tour
&nbsp;  

### Discovering the Heart of Mexico City

Mexico City is a metropolis of contrasts, where ancient history meets modern vibrancy. As one of the largest and most populous cities in the world, its age is a paradox. If we consider the foundation of Mexico-Tenochtitlan by the ancient Mexica in the mid-14th century, it is relatively young. However, if we focus on its historical essence as an agglomeration of around 50 small regions, each an ancient city-state, its age spans over 2,000 years.

### Exploring Tenochtitlan and the Zócalo

Begin your journey at the historic center of the city, Tenochtitlan, and the Plaza de la Constitución, more commonly known as the Zócalo. Here, you’ll find iconic government buildings and the majestic Cathedral. At the National Palace, the seat of the Federal Executive Power, explore the staircase of the Empress, the Presidential balcony, and the central and back patios. Admire the vibrant murals by Diego Rivera, which depict the rich tapestry of Mexico's history.

Next, be captivated by the grandeur of the Cathedral, with its Altar of the Kings, the Archangel, Pinnacle, Metropolitan Sacrarium, and the Altar of Forgiveness.
