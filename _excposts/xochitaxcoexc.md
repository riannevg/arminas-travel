### Main Information

### Xochicalco archaeological zone

Xochicalco is a pre-Columbian archaeological site in the western part of the Mexican state of Morelos. The name “Xochicalco” means “in the house of Flowers” in the Nahuatl language.

It was an area developed during the period 800 to 900 A.D., between the destruction of Teotihuacan (Aztec) and the beginning of Tollan (Toltec). Xochicalco was not only the oldest known fortress in Middle America, but also a religious center.

The Quetzalcoatl pyramid, or Temple of the Feathered Serpent, features friezes depicting the Plumed Serpent coiling around the sides. This structure measures 21 by 19 meters at its base and 17 meters in height and is situated in what is known as Xochicalco’s Acropolis. In another construction which appears to be a ceremonial ramp and which is now protected by a canopy, there are over 250 stones carved with figures of snakes, birds and various other animals.

### The colonial town of Taxco

Taxco , the “silver city”. The city tumbles across a hillside with winding cobblestone streets, tile-roofed buildings, cozy squares, and a strong Old World ambience that has survived through hundreds of years. Visit one of Mexico’s grandest churches, Santa Prisca.

It was built in 1759 by French immigrant Jose de la Borda who literally stumbled upon a huge silver spring. Visit the marketplace and the famous silversmith shops. Below the main hill fortress are many terraced ridges holding lesser structures that have not yet been excavated. The view from the hilltop and pyramids to the surrounding valley is spectacular.
