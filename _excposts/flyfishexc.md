### Main Information
For the fly rodder, spin fisherman or baitcaster, Boca Paila is one of the very best flat fisheries in the Atlantic or the Caribbean. Boca Paila is best known for superb bonefishing and unparalleled permit population, but thereÂ´s a bonus: tarpon, snook, barracuda, jack crevalle and cubera snapper. Boca Paila Fishing Lodge offers half day and full day fishing experiences. Sequestered along a palm-dotted expanse of a serene white sand beach front, Boca Paila is truly an oasis for saltwater flats anglers and their non-fishing companions. The most prized trophy in Boca Paila is the permit, wich can be caught all year round in the Sian Kaan Reserve. Catching this most elusive fish requires a good level of casting, speed and precision, as well as the appropriate fly.
