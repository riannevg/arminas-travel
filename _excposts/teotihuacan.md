## Teotihuacan

&nbsp;

Teotihuacan, often referred to as the "City of the Gods," is a captivating archaeological site that offers a glimpse into ancient civilizations. This historic site is home to majestic structures built by tribes whose identities remain shrouded in mystery, including the Aztecs, who were among the last to witness the arrival of Spanish conquerors in the 16th century. The grandeur of its pyramids and the enigma of its ruins make Teotihuacan a must-visit destination.
