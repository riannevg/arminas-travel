Often referred to as the "Lagoon of Seven Colors" due to its varying shades of blue. Bacalar offers
a peaceful retreat away from more crowded destinations. This charming town, with its rich history
and natural beauty, stands out for its unique landscapes and relaxed pace of life.

**Highlights and Attractions**

The main attraction of Bacalar is clearly its stunning lagoon, a 42-kilometer stretch of crystal-clear
water that shifts from turquoise to deep blue. A must-visit landmark is the Bacalar Fort, also known
as the Fort of San Felipe. This 18th-century fortress offers panoramic views of the lagoon and
houses a museum that explores the town’s pirate-filled past. Another gem is Cenote Azul, a deep
natural sinkhole, perfect for swimming and diving, surrounded by lush greenery.

**Activities and Adventures**

Bacalar is a great destination for water enthusiasts. Kayaking and paddleboarding on the lagoon’s
calm waters are popular activities, offering a way to appreciate its vibrant colors and peaceful
atmosphere. For those looking for more adventure, Cenote Cocalitos provides the chance to explore
underwater caves and tunnels. Boat tours are another excellent option to discover the lagoon’s
highlights, including the famous “Pirate’s Channel,” a narrow waterway once used by pirates as a
hideout.
