Los Cabos, situated at the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula, is a dazzling destination where the desert landscape merges with the azure waters of the Sea of Cortez. Comprised of two main towns, Cabo San Lucas and San José del Cabo, this region offers a unique blend of natural beauty, luxury resorts, and vibrant nightlife. From its iconic rock formations to its pristine beaches, Los Cabos provides a stunning backdrop for both relaxation and adventure.

**Highlights and Attractions**

One of Los Cabos’ most iconic landmarks is El Arco, a dramatic rock formation at Land’s End where the Pacific Ocean meets the Sea of Cortez. A boat tour to this natural wonder is a must-do, offering breathtaking views and opportunities for snorkeling in the clear waters. Cabo San Lucas is known for its lively marina, bustling with shops, restaurants, and nightlife. In contrast, San José del Cabo exudes a more laid-back, artsy vibe, with charming colonial architecture, art galleries, and the historic San José Mission.

**Activities and Adventures**

Los Cabos is a paradise for outdoor enthusiasts. The region’s waters are teeming with marine life, making it a premier destination for sport fishing, diving, and snorkeling. Whale watching is a seasonal highlight, with humpback and gray whales migrating to the warm waters from December to April. The desert landscape also offers exciting opportunities for land-based adventures, such as off-road tours, horseback riding, and hiking. Golfers will find world-class courses designed by legendary players, offering stunning ocean views.
