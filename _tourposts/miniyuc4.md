# Multi-day tour from Cancun including Ek Balam, Chichen Itza, Palenque, Uxmal, Campeche, Xel-Ha

### Day 1: Cancun – Ek Balam – Chichen Itza – Merida

You will visit Ek Balam, a very interesting archaeological site located about 30 kms from the Valladolid. Ek Balam with its fantastic discoveries of the last decades, would have turned upside down the usual understanding of the Mayan culture. It may have been a political entity of great wealth and prosperity.
Only the “Kremlin” is open to our view while the rest of the city is covered by the thickness of the jungle. You will see the Acropolis, Ball Game court, The Twin Buildings, the Observatory, and the Temascal. Afterward, we will take you to Chichen-Itza, named one of the 7 Wonders of the Modern World, and the great representative of the Mayan culture. Only the selected ones, like the magicians, scientists, and the ball players were able to access to this special landscape of white stone and to the “eyes” of the earth, the cenotes. Its splendid Temples, which are considered as belonging to the classical and post-classical periods, never saw the Spanish colonizers because these buildings had already been abandoned by its people due to unknown reasons. Will see the Pyramid of Kukulkan, “the feathered serpent”, the ball games court, the Observatory and more. After that, we will continue to the cenote Ik-Kil where you will have the opportunity to swim.
