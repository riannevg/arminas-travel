## Mini Yucatan 4

&nbsp;

### Day 1: Cancun – Ek Balam – Chichen Itza – Merida

You will start by visiting Ek Balam, an intriguing archaeological site located about 30 km from Valladolid. Recent discoveries at Ek Balam have revolutionized the understanding of Mayan culture, suggesting it was a politically influential and prosperous city. While only the “Kremlin” is visible, the rest of the city remains hidden under jungle vegetation. Explore the Acropolis, Ball Game Court, Twin Buildings, Observatory, and Temazcal. Next, proceed to Chichen Itza, one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World and a prime example of Mayan civilization. This site, once accessible only to the elite—such as magicians, scientists, and ball players—features splendid temples and cenotes that were abandoned before the arrival of Spanish colonizers. Admire the Pyramid of Kukulkan, the ball court, the Observatory, and more. Afterward, visit the cenote Ik-Kil for a refreshing swim. Overnight in Merida.

### Day 3: Campeche – Waterfall Misol Ha – Palenque

Begin the day with a tour of Campeche, known for its well-preserved baroque colonial buildings and historic walled district. The city’s colonial Spanish walls and fortifications were crucial in defending it from pirates. Campeche’s preservation earned it UNESCO World Heritage Site status in 1999. Next, visit the coastal area of Sabancuy and the stunning Misol Ha waterfall. Continue to Palenque for an overnight stay.

This mystical city, nestled deep in the Chiapas jungle, is surrounded by dense vegetation. Travel to Chetumal for the evening.
