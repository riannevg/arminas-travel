The Frida Kahlo house-museum is full of her art. In the museum there are personal items and collections of Frida and her husband, the famous Mexican painter Diego Rivera. The house of Trotsky is an interesting museum dedicated to this political and historical figure. Lev Trotsky came to Mexico in 1937 looking for a political asylum that the then president of the country Lazaro Cardenas granted him.
