### Day 2: Ancient Uxmal & the Flamingos of Celestún

Step back in time with a visit to Uxmal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site renowned for its intricate Puuc-style architecture. Explore the Pyramid of the Magician, the Governor's Palace, and other ceremonial structures surrounded by jungle.

In the afternoon, head west to Celestún, a tranquil nature reserve and coastal fishing village. Enjoy a boat tour through the mangroves, where you’ll witness vibrant wildlife—especially the flocks of pink flamingos that call this biosphere home. A serene contrast to the ruins of the morning.

Afterwards, refresh with a swim in a cenote, one of the Yucatán’s mystical underground pools with crystal-clear waters.
