## Mini Yucatan 3

&nbsp;  

### Day 1: Cancun/Riviera Maya – Caverns – Tulum – Coba – Chetumal

From Cancun, we will start our journey by visiting caverns with stunning stalactites and cenotes, known as “the eyes of the earth.” These sites are fantastic for swimming, diving, or snorkeling. Next, we’ll head to Tulum, an ancient Mayan city renowned for its archaeological zone situated by the beautiful turquoise waters of the Caribbean Sea. Later, we’ll visit Coba, another intriguing Mayan site immersed in the jungle. Enjoy a bicycle tour of the city before arriving in Chetumal, known as the city of pirates.

### Day 2: Chetumal – Kohunlich and Chicanna – Palenque

We will journey along the ancient route of the Rio Bec, visiting two fascinating archaeological sites: Kohunlich, a Mayan city located near the Mexico-Belize border, and Chicanna, situated in southern Campeche. After exploring these historic sites, we will proceed to Palenque.

### Day 3: Palenque – Campeche

Explore the magnificent archaeological site of Palenque, one of the most impressive locations of the Mayan civilization. Discover the stone portraits of priests and Emperor Pakal II, the Temple of the Sun and the Cross, and the famous “spaceman” image on Pakal’s sarcophagus. This enigmatic city, nestled deep within the Chiapas jungle, is surrounded by lush vegetation. We will then travel to the port city of Campeche, known for its well-preserved baroque colonial buildings, military architecture, and historic walled district. Campeche’s state of preservation earned it UNESCO World Heritage Site status in 1999. Enjoy a city tour of Campeche.

### Day 4: Campeche – Chichen Itza – Cenote – Cancun/Riviera Maya

Depart from Campeche in the morning to visit Chichen Itza, one of the Seven New Wonders of the World and a prime representative of Mayan culture. This ancient site, once accessible only to the elite—magicians, scientists, and ball players—features magnificent temples of classical and post-classical Mexico that the Spanish colonizers never saw, as they were abandoned before their arrival. Marvel at the Pyramid of Kukulkan, the ball court, the Observatory, and more. After exploring Chichen Itza, continue to the cenote Ik-Kil for a refreshing swim. Return to Cancun or Riviera Maya to conclude your tour.
