In the 17th century, large amounts of copper and other minerals were mined here. The canyon’s lowlands support a tropical ecosystem with orchids, oranges, mangoes, and avocados. It is home to around 50,000 Tarahumara Indians, considered among the most traditional people in North America. Enjoy spectacular views of Chihuahua before returning to the hotel.

### Day 6: Bahuichivo - El Fuerte

Transfer to Bahuichivo’s railway station and continue to El Fuerte in the State of Sinaloa. Enjoy stunning views as you cross kilometers of Copper Canyon in the Sierra Madre mountains, featuring giant cacti, overgrown hills, red cliffs, tunnels, beautiful bridges, and waterfalls. Arrive in El Fuerte and check in at your hotel. El Fuerte is a small, harmonious town known for its historical, natural, and architectural attractions. The town, included in the list of “Mexico’s Magic Towns,” is also famous for the legend of Zorro. Visit the preserved house of the national hero and watch the “Happy Hour with Zorro” show. Enjoy free time to explore the town.

### Day 7: El Fuerte - Los Mochis

In the morning, consider a visit to the El Fuerte River to experience the diverse wildlife of the region, especially the variety of bird species. The river is peaceful and ideal for families. Transfer to Los Mochis Airport (about 2 hours).
