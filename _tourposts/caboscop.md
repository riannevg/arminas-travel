## Los Cabos to the Copper Canyon

&nbsp;

### Day 1: Los Cabos – Todos Santos – The Famous “Hotel California” – La Paz

Breakfast at the hotel. Transfer to Todos Santos, a beautiful small town in Baja California with a population of no more than 7,000 people. It is situated one hour driving south from La Paz and one hour driving north from Cabo San Lucas in the foothills of Sierra de la Laguna. The town faces the Pacific Ocean, surrounded by lush greenery, including palms, mangoes, and avocado trees. Recently, this town was included in the list of “Mexico’s Magic Towns” for its history and ancient architecture. Enjoy a walking tour through the center of the town. We highly recommend you take the opportunity to have lunch at the very famous “Hotel California,” which is mentioned in the song “Hotel California” by the Eagles. Todos Santos is a small pearl in the middle of the desert. After lunch, transfer to La Paz to check in at the hotel. Time for rest.

### Day 2: La Paz – Los Mochis – El Fuerte

Travel by ferry or flight from La Paz to Los Mochis (according to your request and availability). Upon arrival, you have the option to visit Topolobampo Bay, famous for its marine park. The bay is home to tunas, shrimps, shells, oysters, and crabs. It’s part port, part reserve. Transfer for about two hours to the picturesque town of El Fuerte, located in the state of Sinaloa. El Fuerte is a small but harmonious town that combines historical, natural, and architectural attractions. The local people have preserved traditions and cultural values for centuries, which is why the town was registered in the list of “Mexico’s Magic Towns.” The famous legend of the brave Zorro originated here. Locals claim this character was real, naming him Don Diego de la Vega. The house of this national hero is preserved, and tourists can enjoy the “Happy Hour with Zorro” show. After the tour, check in at the hotel. Free time to explore this beautiful town.

### Day 3: El Fuerte – Divisadero

Transfer from the hotel to the train station to board the exciting “Chepe” Express. This will be an amazing experience as you journey through the Copper Canyon, located in the “Sierra Madre Occidental” mountain range. The train ride offers breathtaking views of giant cacti, overgrown hills, red cliffs, tunnels, beautiful bridges, and waterfalls. Upon arrival in Divisadero, transfer to the hotel. Enjoy a walking tour along the edge of the canyon. Don’t forget your camera to capture the fantastic sunset. Time for rest.

### Day 4: Divisadero – Creel

Breakfast at the hotel. Enjoy free time in the morning. We recommend walking around the area to take stunning pictures of the canyon and the “Piedra Volada,” situated on the canyon’s edge. Discover the way of life and traditions of the Tarahumara people. For an additional cost, you can visit “Aventura Park” where you can participate in unique activities such as the world’s longest zipline (2,554 meters), Via Ferrata, and Rappel. Later, transfer to Creel. Creel is the historical center of the Tarahumara, who live on the mountainsides, among canyons, in remote high-mountain areas. The town has craft producers and small shops that showcase the culture and habits of this indigenous people. We recommend visiting the “Casa de las Artesanias” gift store, where you can purchase various arts and crafts. Time for rest. Night in the hotel.

### Day 5: Creel – Mennonites Community - Chihuahua

Today, visit the spectacular and serene Lake Arareko, located 5 km south of Creel. Other points of interest include the thermal waters of Recowata and the unusual rock formations in Valle de Los Hongos. Next, visit the village of the indigenous Tarahumara people. The Tarahumara, whose name translates to “foot-runner,” are Native Americans known for their long-distance running ability. Their record is not in speed but in endurance. The tour continues in Cuauhtémoc, home to one of the largest Mennonite communities. Mennonites are a Protestant group similar to Baptists. You’ll see their homes and have the chance to taste their delicious cheese, freshly baked bread, jams, cookies, apple pies – all made by the hardworking Mennonites. Arrival in Chihuahua for hotel check-in. Time for rest.
