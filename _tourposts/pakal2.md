## Pakal Tour
 
Follow the footsteps of great Maya rulers through the heart of the Chiapas rainforest. The Pakal Tour invites you to uncover ancient cities hidden beneath jungle canopies, bathe in the turquoise waters of cascading rivers, and witness the enduring legacy of one of Mesoamerica’s most fascinating civilisations. From Palenque to the depths of the Lacandon jungle, this journey is rich in mystery, beauty, and adventure.
