### Day 1: Cancun – Chichen Itza – Merida

Early in the morning, embark on an adventure to visit Chichen Itza, one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World. This ancient site, where only the elite—magicians, scientists, and ball players—had access, features spectacular temples made of white stone and cenotes, known as “eyes of the earth.” Admire the Pyramid of Kukulkan, the ball court, the Observatory, and more. After exploring Chichen Itza, you’ll visit the Ik-Kil cenote, where you can swim in its pristine waters. The day concludes in the charming city of Merida, the capital of Yucatan state. Overnight in Merida.

### Day 2: Merida – Uxmal – Pink Flamingo Reserve Celestun – Merida

From Merida, travel to Uxmal, one of the most significant archaeological sites of the Mayan culture, alongside Chichen Itza and Tikal. Uxmal, located in the Puuc region, is renowned for its unique architectural style and has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1996. Next, head to the Celestun Biosphere Reserve, a natural haven for around 150 species of birds, reptiles, mammals, and fish, including the Pink Flamingo. Return to Merida for the night.
